Based on the rich text editor encapsulated by react-quill, the quill component can be used to parse the rich text content of the component in other systems.

## Notes

<p><strong>RichText is a component based on react-quill. <font color="red">Since react-quill is no longer maintained</font>, it is not recommended for use if you need feature extensions.</strong></p>

## When to use

**If you are using the HZERO framework for front-end development, it is recommended to directly use the more powerful [RichTextEditor](https://open.hand-china.com/document-center/doc/product/10137/10227?doc_id=32692&doc_code=32692)。**
